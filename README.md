# IA_Image_Recognition

Hello, here my IA of number recognition

So, there 2 files :
-Recognition_Image_Number_Neural_Network/ which train/learn (create generation) to recognize number with all images in the file, and after recognize the number of the image you give
-Recognition_Image_Number_Neural_Network_Without_Generation where the neural network trained is stocked in weight.tx. So there no need to train, he just recognize the number of the image you give

How to test ?

First : Your image have to be in .bmp extension in 28x28 pixels

Second : You have to install the library SDL, SDL Image, Makefile

Third : Write in the console Make (it will compile the project)

Fourth : Test with your image ! ( ./a.out your_image.bmp )
